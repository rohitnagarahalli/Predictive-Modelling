# Predictive-Modelling
Consists of data, code and business report performed on two different data sets. Regression was performed for continuous quantitate data and classification for binary target variable. 

The comp-activ database comprises activity measures of computer systems. Data was 
gathered from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory, operating in a multiuser university department. Users engaged in diverse tasks, such as internet access, file 
editing, and CPU-intensive programs

The aim is to establish a linear equation for predicting 'usr' (the percentage of time CPUs 
operate in user mode). Also, to analyse various system attributes to understand their 
influence on the system's 'usr' mode.
